[{"body":" This is a placeholder page that shows you how to use this template site.\nThe Overview is where your users find out about your project. Depending on the size of your docset, you can have a separate overview page (like this one) or put your overview contents in the Documentation landing page (like in the Docsy User Guide).\nTry answering these questions for your user in this page:\nWhat is it? Introduce your project, including what it does or lets you do, why you would use it, and its primary goal (and how it achieves it). This should be similar to your README description, though you can go into a little more detail here if you want.\nWhy do I want it? Help your user know if your project will help them. Useful information can include:\nWhat is it good for?: What types of problems does your project solve? What are the benefits of using it?\nWhat is it not good for?: For example, point out situations that might intuitively seem suited for your project, but aren’t for some reason. Also mention known limitations, scaling issues, or anything else that might let your users know if the project is not for them.\nWhat is it not yet good for?: Highlight any useful features that are coming soon.\nWhere should I go next? Give your users next steps from the Overview. For example:\nGetting Started: Get started with $project Examples: Check out some example code!

This could include downloading/installation instructions, including any prerequisites or system requirements.\nIntroductory “Hello World” example, if appropriate. More complex tutorials should live in the Tutorials section.\nConsider using the headings below for your getting started page. You can delete any that are not applicable to your project.\nPrerequisites Are there any system requirements for using your project? What languages are supported (if any)? Do users need to already have any software or tools installed?\nInstallation Where can your user find your project code? How can they install it (binaries, installable package, build from source)? Are there multiple options/versions they can install and how should they choose the right one for them?\nSetup Is there any initial setup users need to do after installation to try your project?\nTry it out! Can your users test their installation, for example by running a command or deploying a Hello World example?\n","categories":["Examples","Placeholders"],"description":"Getting started with Meshtastic","excerpt":"Getting started with Meshtastic","ref":"/docs/getting-started/","tags":["test","docs"],"title":"Getting Started"},{"body":" This is a placeholder page that shows you how to use this template site.\nDo you have any example applications or code for your users in your repo or elsewhere?

However if there are areas where your users will need a more detailed understanding of a given term or feature in order to do anything useful with your project (or to not make mistakes when using it) put that information in this section. For example, you may want to add some conceptual pages if you have a large project with many components and a complex architecture.\nRemember to focus on what the user needs to know, not just what you think is interesting about your project! If they don’t need to understand your original design decisions to use or contribute to the project, don’t put them in, or include your design docs in your repo and link to them. Similarly, most users will probably need to know more about how features work when in use rather than how they are implemented. Consider a separate architecture page for more detailed implementation and system design information that potential project contributors can consult.\n","categories":"","description":"What does your user need to understand about your project in order to use it - or potentially contribute to it?\n","excerpt":"What does your user need to understand about your project in order to …","ref":"/docs/concepts/","tags":"","title":"Concepts"},{"body":"We use Hugo to format and generate our website, the Docsy theme for styling and site structure, and Netlify to manage the deployment of the site. Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.\nUpdating a single page If you’ve just spotted something you’d like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:\nClick Edit this page in the top right hand corner of the page. If you don’t already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click Fork this repository and propose changes or Update your Fork to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode. Follow the rest of the Quick start with Netlify process to make, preview, and propose your changes. Creating an issue If you’ve found a problem in the docs, but you’re not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the Hoosier Mesh repo. You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the Create Issue button in the top right hand corner of the page.\nQuick start with Netlify Here’s a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you’re familiar with the GitHub workflow and you’re happy to use the automated preview of your doc updates:\nFork the Hoosier Mesh repo on GitHub. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR). If you’re not yet ready for a review, add “WIP” to the PR name to indicate it’s a work in progress. (Don’t add the Hugo property “draft = true” to the page front matter, because that prevents the auto-deployment of the content preview described in the next point.) Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it’s ready, you should see a comment like this: deploy/netlify — Deploy preview ready! Click Details to the right of “Deploy preview ready” to see a preview of your updates. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you’re happy with the content. When you’re ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any “WIP” markers. Previewing your changes locally If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:\nFollow the instructions in Getting started to install Hugo and any other tools you need. You’ll need at least Hugo version 0.146.0 (we recommend using the most recent available version), and it must be the extended version, which supports SCSS.\nFork the Hoosier Mesh repo repo into your own project, then create a local copy using git clone.\ngit clone --branch v0.12.0 --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git Run hugo server in the site root directory. By default your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/. Now that you’re serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.\nContinue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.\nCreating an issue If you’ve found a problem in the docs, but you’re not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the Hoosier Mesh repo. You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the Create Issue button in the top right hand corner of the page.\nUseful resources Docsy user guide: All about Docsy, including how it manages navigation, look and feel, and multi-language support.
