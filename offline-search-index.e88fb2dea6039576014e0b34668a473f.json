[{"body":"Before You Begin Critical Safety Warning Never power on your device without attaching an antenna! Powering on the radio without an antenna attached could damage the radio chip.\nVerify Your Data Cable Before connecting your device to your computer, make sure your USB cable supports both charging AND data transfer. Some cables are charge-only and won’t work for flashing firmware.\nTo verify your cable:\nTry connecting it to your phone or another device Attempt to copy a file to or from the device If file transfer works, your cable can also transfer data and is ready to use Step 1: Identify Your Board Before you begin, you’ll need to decide on your first device. Check out our Get a Node guide to help you choose the right hardware for your needs and budget.\nOnce you have your device, identify its manufacturer and designation (e.g., ESP32, nRF52, RP2040). You’ll need this information to select the correct drivers and firmware.\nBoard Name \u0026 Designation: _______________________\nChoosing the Right Device Meshtastic supports several chipset types, each with different advantages:\nESP32-based devices: Equipped with WiFi and Bluetooth; ideal for web interface access and WiFi configuration. ESP32-S3 variants offer improved performance. The Heltec V3 or V4 are excellent options if you’re powering from mains. Higher power consumption than nRF52.\nnRF52-based devices: Much more power efficient than ESP32; ideal for battery-powered and solar deployments. Equipped with Bluetooth only (no WiFi). Uses the UF2 bootloader for easy updates. Easier to maintain on battery power.\nRP2040-based devices: Dual-core ARM chip developed by Raspberry Pi. Cost-effective for DIY projects. Don’t typically require serial drivers; they use the UF2 bootloader and appear as flash drives.\nSemtech-based devices: Choose newer SX126x or LR11xx series for improved performance over the older SX127x series\nBuying Your First Radio Heltec is a great choice if you’re powering the device from mains power. They’re more affordable, have excellent case support available, and are well-established in the community.\nWisBlock offers more flexibility and features for battery-powered applications, though at a slightly higher price point.\nTip Don’t worry about having a perfect case right away! Many community members repurpose everyday items as cases until they’re ready to invest in a 3D-printed solution.\nStep 2: Install Drivers and Firmware Browser Requirements Important You must use Chrome or Microsoft Edge to access the Meshtastic installer. Other browsers are not supported.\nVisit the Meshtastic website and navigate to the Getting Started section Follow the instructions for your device type to download and install any necessary drivers Driver Notes nRF52 and RP2040 Devices These devices typically do not require serial drivers. They use the UF2 bootloader which makes the devices appear as flash drives. Do NOT download USB device drivers unless required to install UF2 support.\nOnly download serial drivers if your device requires them After installing drivers (if needed), restart your computer to ensure the operating system is updated Flash Firmware Return to the Meshtastic.org Getting Started section Use the web flasher or follow the provided instructions to flash the Meshtastic firmware onto your device Step 3: Initial Node Configuration Access the settings menu by pressing the settings cog icon. The recommended configuration for nodes in the Indiana mesh network is documented in detail on the Node Configuration Reference page.\nHere are the key things to configure:\nLoRa Settings: Set region to US 915, preset to “Long Range - Fast” Channels: Configure the default “Long Fast” channel User Configuration: Set your node name and long/short identifiers Device Role: Set to CLIENT (or CLIENT_BASE for roof nodes) Position: Enable position broadcasting at 6-hour intervals For the complete list of recommended settings for each category, see the Node Configuration Reference.\nAdvanced Configuration For information on advanced configuration options including MQTT, Serial, Telemetry, and External Notifications, see the Advanced Configuration Guide.\nLearning \u0026 Support Resources Configuration Guides For detailed configuration help, check out these excellent resources:\nMeshtastic Official Documentation - Comprehensive official docs CommsChannel on YouTube - Great for video walkthroughs of radio setup and configuration Upgrading Your Antenna Once you’re up and running, consider upgrading your antenna for better range and performance.

Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.\nUpdating a single page If you’ve just spotted something you’d like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:\nClick Edit this page in the top right hand corner of the page. If you don’t already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click Fork this repository and propose changes or Update your Fork to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode. Follow the rest of the Quick start with Netlify process to make, preview, and propose your changes. Creating an issue If you’ve found a problem in the docs, but you’re not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the Hoosier Mesh repo. You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the Create Issue button in the top right hand corner of the page.\nQuick start with Netlify Here’s a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you’re familiar with the GitHub workflow and you’re happy to use the automated preview of your doc updates:\nFork the Hoosier Mesh repo on GitHub. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR). If you’re not yet ready for a review, add “WIP” to the PR name to indicate it’s a work in progress. (Don’t add the Hugo property “draft = true” to the page front matter, because that prevents the auto-deployment of the content preview described in the next point.) Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it’s ready, you should see a comment like this: deploy/netlify — Deploy preview ready! Click Details to the right of “Deploy preview ready” to see a preview of your updates. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you’re happy with the content. When you’re ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any “WIP” markers. Previewing your changes locally If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:\nFollow the instructions in Getting started to install Hugo and any other tools you need. You’ll need at least Hugo version 0.146.0 (we recommend using the most recent available version), and it must be the extended version, which supports SCSS.\nFork the Hoosier Mesh repo repo into your own project, then create a local copy using git clone.\ngit clone --branch v0.12.0 --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git Run hugo server in the site root directory. By default your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/. Now that you’re serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.\nContinue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.\nCreating an issue If you’ve found a problem in the docs, but you’re not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the Hoosier Mesh repo.
