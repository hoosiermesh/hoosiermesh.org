# Hoosier Mesh

Welcome to Hoosier Mesh! We're a grassroots community dedicated to building and expanding [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org) mesh communication networks across Indiana.

## About This Project

Hoosier Mesh is a community-driven initiative focused on promoting the use of open-source mesh communication technologies—specifically Meshtastic—to create a resilient, decentralized communication infrastructure throughout the Hoosier state.

## What is Meshtastic?

[Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org) is an open-source, off-grid, long-range communication platform that uses inexpensive LoRa radios to create mesh networks. With Meshtastic, you can:
- Send text messages without cell service or internet
- Share GPS locations and telemetry data
- Build a decentralized communication network in your community
- Stay connected when traditional services aren't available

## Our Mission

Hoosier Mesh brings together Meshtastic enthusiasts across Indiana to:
- 📡 Build and maintain mesh network coverage across the state
- 📚 Educate the community about Meshtastic and mesh networking
- 🤝 Connect local mesh communities and coordinate infrastructure
- 🛠️ Share resources, documentation, and best practices
- 🎯 Organize events, meetups, and node deployment activities

## Getting Started with Meshtastic

1. **Get a Node** - Purchase a Meshtastic-compatible LoRa device (typically $50-120)
