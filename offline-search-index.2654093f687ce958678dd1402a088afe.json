[{"body":"Before you begin Critical Safety Warning Never power on your device without attaching an antenna! Powering on the radio without an antenna attached could damage the radio chip.\nVerify your data cable Before connecting your device to your computer, make sure your USB cable supports both charging and data transfer. Some cables are charge-only and won’t work for flashing firmware.\nTo verify your cable:\nTry connecting it to your phone or another device Attempt to copy a file to or from the device If file transfer works, your cable can also transfer data and is ready to use Identify your board Before you begin, decide on your first device. Check out the Get a Node guide to help you choose the right hardware for your needs and budget.\nOnce you have your device, identify its manufacturer and designation (for example ESP32, nRF52, RP2040). You will need this information to select the correct drivers and firmware.\nBoard name and designation: _______________________\nChipset overview Meshtastic supports several chipset types, each with different advantages:\nESP32-based devices: Equipped with WiFi and Bluetooth; ideal for web interface access and WiFi configuration. ESP32-S3 variants offer improved performance. Higher power consumption than nRF52. nRF52-based devices: Much more power efficient than ESP32; ideal for battery-powered and solar deployments. Equipped with Bluetooth only (no WiFi). Uses the UF2 bootloader for easy updates. RP2040-based devices: Dual-core ARM chip developed by Raspberry Pi. Cost-effective for DIY projects. Use the UF2 bootloader and appear as flash drives. Semtech-based devices: Choose newer SX126x or LR11xx series for improved performance over the older SX127x series.

For ham operation, you must configure an unencrypted channel.\nPSK (Pre-Shared Key): Must be set to a default/empty value for no encryption Consider creating a separate channel for ham-only communications Power \u0026 Frequency Considerations Transmit Power Unlicensed: Limited to 1 watt EIRP (Effective Isotropic Radiated Power) on ISM bands Licensed: May use higher power levels within amateur radio band limits (check local regulations) Configure appropriately in LoRa settings based on your license class Frequency Bands ISM Band (915 MHz): Available for both licensed and unlicensed use Amateur Allocations: Consult your local amateur radio band plan Ensure your device is configured for legal frequencies in your region Station Identification Per FCC Part 97.119:\nStation identification is required at the end of each communication and at least every 10 minutes during communication Include your callsign in your node’s Long Name for automatic identification Consider periodic position beacons to meet ID requirements Power Output \u0026 EIRP Understanding EIRP Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) = Transmitter Power + Antenna Gain - Cable Loss\nPower Limits Part 15 (Unlicensed): 1 watt EIRP maximum Part 97 (Amateur): Varies by band and license class Technician: Check specific band limits General/Extra: Higher power privileges on most bands Example Calculation Transmitter: 30 dBm (1 watt) Antenna Gain: +3 dBi Cable Loss: -0.5 dB EIRP = 30 + 3 - 0.5 = 32.5 dBm (≈1.78 watts) For unlicensed operation, this would exceed the 1-watt EIRP limit.\nBest Practices for Ham Operators Clearly mark licensed operation - Use callsign in node name Document your configuration - Note power levels, antenna specs, and EIRP calculations Separate licensed/unlicensed operation - Consider different devices or channels Join the community - Connect with other ham operators on Indiana Mesh Discord Stay current - FCC rules and interpretations can evolve High-Power Station Options For licensed operators seeking high-power operation:\nB\u0026Q Station G2 - High-power licensed station designed for amateur radio use Custom Builds - Many operators build custom high-power stations with external amplifiers Reminder Always ensure your configuration complies with your license class privileges and local regulations.
